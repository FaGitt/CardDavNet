# CardDav.Net
C# .Net Implementation of the CardDav Client Protocol

Originally based off of:

Written from the ground up in C#, with vCard Reader and Writer from: 
http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/16030/NET-vCard-API-for-creating-and-parsing-vCards

Thanks Lumi!

Though the vCard reader and writer needs to be updated to meet the new vCard 4.0 specification!

Google has completely removed CalDav and CardDav support. Thanks Google, for not supporting open standards that everyone else supports. "Do no evil," my ass!

Be sure to replace the word username with the proper email account you are trying to access.

Simple usage for connecting to Google's CardDav:

		using CardDav;
		using CardDav.Card;
		using CardDav.Response;

		CardDav.Client client = new CardDav.Client("url of carddav server go here", "username", "some password");

		CardDavResponse response = client.Get();

		/** Output the results from the Listing **/

		//Assuming you have a result text box to output too :P

		resultsTxt.Text = response.ToString();

		/** Set the client to the proper Address Book server URL **/
		// This is heavily assumming that there are address books and vcards!
		// Always check to see if CardDavResponse.AddressBooks.Count > 0
		// And always check to see if CardDavResponse.Cards.Count > 0

		client.SetServer(response.AddressBooks.First().Url.ToString());
		vCard card = client.GetVCard(response.Cards.First().Id);

		//Assuming you have a result text box to output too :P

		resultsTxt.Text = resultsTxt.Text + "\r\n\r\n\r\n" + card.ToString();

To see a demo application compile and run the CardDavDemo project.
